Lannisport is a [Pelican][1] theme. The original repository can be found [here][4]. This is a modified version of the theme, which can be seen in action at https://kevindprice.github.io/.

## Preview

## Modifications
This theme:

 * displays article summaries on the home page by default instead of the entire article.
 * automatically detects when an article is summarized and adds an intuitive - continued - button.
 * displays the article category directly under the title, next to the publish date.
 * contains improved fonts in the "categories" pages.
 * the sidebar moves to the bottom on small screens instead of disappearing.
 * contains some additional adjustments and fixes in stylesheets (spacing).
 
This modified theme should ideally be used together with the "summary" plugin to make for a cleaner homepage. This plugin allows you to customize summary lengths.
